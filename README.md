# 🚍 Bus Operation Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes bus ticket sales and operations to optimize scheduling, pricing, and route efficiency. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help improve service reliability, reduce operational costs, and boost revenue. 

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset used in this project is confidential as it was part of a live project during my internship at AiSPRY (360DigiTMG). Therefore, it is not publicly shared.

## 🧪 Data Understanding

- **Data Source:** Ticket sales and operational data (live project)
- **Sample Fields:** Route No, Fare Type, Ticket Type, Distance, Boarding Point, Travel Time, etc.
- **Privacy Note:** Dataset cannot be shared due to confidentiality.

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Peak Hour Analysis:** To adjust schedules based on passenger load
- **Route Utilization:** To identify overused/underused routes
- **Fare Type Distribution:** To understand revenue by ticket type
- **Travel Time Analysis:** To find delays and route issues
- **Revenue Mapping:** To highlight profitable and loss-making routes

---

## 📊 Dashboards & Visualizations

Created with **Power BI** and **Looker Studio**:

- Passenger Heatmap
- Revenue Trend Lines
- Route Utilization Matrix
- Fare Type Pie Charts
- Travel Time Boxplots

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Peak hours showed high crowding on specific routes
- Some routes had low occupancy but high costs
- Fare mismatches led to loss of revenue
- Few stops had too many boardings; others were underused

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Increase bus frequency during peak hours
- Optimize or merge underutilized routes
- Implement dynamic pricing based on distance and demand
- Use real-time passenger tracking for smarter decisions

---

## 📈 Impact & Outcome

- Better bus allocation based on real demand
- Improved fare revenue potential
- Enhanced rider experience and schedule reliability
- Easy-to-understand dashboards for business users

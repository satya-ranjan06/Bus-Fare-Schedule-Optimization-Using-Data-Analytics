# Bus-Fare-Schedule-Optimization-Using-Data-Analytics
A data-driven project to analyze and optimize bus schedules and fare pricing based on passenger travel patterns. Built during my internship at AiSPRY (360DigiTMG) using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. (Note: Dataset is confidential due to live project restrictions.)
